/** @brief Set the local Avalon address for the PCIe txs port
* 
* For example, if the core is configured with an address translation table with the
	following attributes :
- Number of Address Pages—16
	- Size of Address Pages—1 MByte
	- PCI Express Address Size—64 bits
	then the values in Figure 4–12 are :
- N = 20 (due to the 1 MByte page size)
	- Q = 16 (number of pages)
	- M = 24 (20 + 4 bit page selection)
	- P = 64
	In this case, the Avalon address is interpreted as follows :
- Bits[31:24] select the TX slave module port from among other slaves connected to
	the same master by the system interconnect fabric.The decode is based on the base
	addresses assigned in Qsys.
	- Bits[23:20] select the address translation table entry.
	- Bits[63:20] of the address translation table entry become PCI Express address bits
	[63:20].
	- Bits[19:0] are passed throughand become PCI Express address bits[19:0].
	The address translation table can be hardwired or dynamically configured at run
	time.When the IP core is parameterized for dynamic address translation, the address
	translation table is implemented in memoryand can be accessed through the CRA
	slave module.This access mode is useful in a typical PCI Express system where
	address allocation occurs after BIOS initialization.

	- Number of Address Pages—2
	- Size of Address Pages—16 MByte
	- PCI Express Address Size—64 bits
	then the values in Figure 4–12 are :
- N = 24 (due to the 16 MByte page size)
	- Q = 2 (number of pages)
	- M = 25 (24 + 1 bit page selection)
	- P = 64
	In this case, the Avalon address is interpreted as follows :
- Bits[31:24] select the TX slave module port  from among other slaves connected to
	the same master by the system interconnect fabric.The decode is based on the base
	addresses assigned in Qsys.
	- Bits[24] select the address translation table entry.
	- Bits[63:25] of the address translation table entry become PCI Express address bits
	[63:20].
	- Bits[23:0] are passed throughand become PCI Express address bits[19:0].
